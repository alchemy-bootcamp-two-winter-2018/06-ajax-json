# Kilovolt Blog: Now With Forms!

**Author**: Keli
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
An example of how a blog might be coded using a front-end only approach. Created as an assignment for Alchemy Code Lab's Bootcamp II.

## Getting Started
Currently, the blog can only be viewed by cloning to your own machine and opening the HTML files in a browswer (ideally, Chrome).

## Architecture
The blog uses HTML, CSS, and JS along with jQuery and Handlebars.

## Change Log
Unclear what level of change I'm documenting here. (Would an entire lab be a change, or should there be nearly as many changes as commits?)

## Credits and Collaborations
Starter code from Codefellows. Thank you to my pair programming partners this week: Henry, Jen, and Stephanie.
