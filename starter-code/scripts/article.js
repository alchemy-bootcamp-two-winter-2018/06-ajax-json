  // Not sure? Check the docs!
  // This is a ternary operator. The item before the question mark is the condition, and asking does the value match. The string before the colon is the action to be taken if the condition returns true, and the string after is the action if false. It is basically a small if/else statement.

// REVIEW: There are some other functions that also relate to all articles across the board, rather than just single instances. Object-oriented programming would call these "class-level" functions, that are relevant to the entire "class" of objects that are Articles.

// REVIEW: This function will take the rawData, how ever it is provided, and use it to instantiate all the articles. This code is moved from elsewhere, and encapsulated in a simply-named function for clarity.

// COMMENT: Where is this function called? What does 'rawData' represent now? How is this different from previous labs?
// The rawData is now a JSON string instead of Javascript, and it is called in the articleView file.
